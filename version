testing_1.0 21/2/26
moved flagless function to a separate function, and the values to a struct declared globally

testing_2.0 22/2/26
added flag support (not quite as modular as i want it to be yet, so maybe i wont push into main just yet)
redid a bit of the error messages too, alongside commenting utils.h properly and removing unused flagutils.h
need input on wether to make functions be in code.c or in a separate header file

testing_3.0
aim to get proper error messages in case something fails that isnt covered in an if check
